This program is a naive-bayesian classifier. This is built up for determine the class of the news.

The articles for training is located at '/data_train', there are 20 different
folder to indicate the class, it can be added with new training materials freely.

The folder '/data_test' also has 20 sub folder in it, and this is the folder to put news
that need to be determine, this method is very helpful when calculating the accuracy rate of
large amount of news, if there is a class-unknown news need to be predict, we can use the
function 'classifier' in 'Object_prob', just input the direction of the article, it will return a
class name that is mostly possible.
